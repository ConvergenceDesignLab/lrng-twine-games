        <p><em>Never, ever give someone else access to your bank information, even a friend.  Watch out for emails or messages on social media from people asking if you want to make quick money by depositing a check for them. They are setting you up for card cracking: they will deposit a fake check and withdraw the money before the bank realizes it's fake. Then YOU could be the one in trouble for fraud and might face big fines and potential jail time.</em></p>
