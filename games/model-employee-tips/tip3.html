        <p>Mistakes are bound to happen. When you take responsibility for your mistakes and don't blame others, it shows integrity and humility.</p>
        
        <p>When you make a mistake, remember to apologize, to suggest some ways you can fix the mistake (if it's fixable), and tell your boss how you plan to avoid the mistake in the future. And you can always ask for help!</p>
